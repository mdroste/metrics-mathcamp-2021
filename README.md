This repository contains the documents that will be used in the econometrics portion of the Harvard Economics math camp for incoming first-year Ph.D. students.

The folder 'Notes' contains a master notes document that covers all of the content we will cover in math camp. 

The folder 'Slides' contains the main sets of slides that I will present during our sessions. 

The folder 'Worksheets' contains worksheets that will be worked on in group problem-solving exercises each day.
